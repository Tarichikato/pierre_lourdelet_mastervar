## Unity


### What is Unity ?

Unity is a cross-platform game engine (smartphone, computer, video game consoles and web) developed by Unity Technologies. It is one of the most widely used game engines in the industry, both for large studios and independents, because of its speed in prototyping and its ability to release games on all platforms

### What did we do ?

### The big project

Now we have to create a game powered by Unity. I am curently working on it and I can show you some first visuals. The idea is to make the player live the strange story of Mr Anderson described in Laylow's album that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvHFJPFOVAY&list=OLAK5uy_kHzByhNGA8TZ6MxNaU1INQaZFr13iQy-M)
